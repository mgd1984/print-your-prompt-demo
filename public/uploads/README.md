# Uploads Directory

This directory stores generated images from the application.

- Generated images are stored here with unique identifiers
- Both JPEG (for display) and TIFF (for high-quality printing) versions may be stored
- This directory is ignored in Git to prevent user-generated content from being committed
- Only this README and the .gitkeep file are tracked to ensure the directory exists

**Note:** Make sure this directory has proper write permissions for the application to function correctly.
